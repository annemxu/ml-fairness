## import libraries

## define lists of models, datasets, and metrics

## iterate through (model, dataset, metric) tuples

#for model in models:
#	for dataset in datasets:
#		## read in data (should already be cleaned and in standard format)
#		
#		## define model w/ parameters if needed
#
#		## apply model to dataset, yield result with predictions
#
#		## import functions for each fairness metric on standardized output format
#		for metric in metrics:
#			## apply fairness metric to predictions
#			
#			## output result (probably by appending to list that becomes result matrix
